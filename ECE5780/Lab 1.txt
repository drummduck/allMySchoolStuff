What are the GPIO control registers that the lab mentions?

What values would you want to write to the bits controlling a pin in the GPIOx_MODER register in order to set it to analog mode?

Examine the bit descriptions in GPIOx_BSSR register, what bit would you want to set to clear the fourth bit in the ODR?

Perform the following bitwise operations:
	0xAD | 0xC7 = ?
	0xAD & 0xC7 = ?
	0xAD & ~(0xC7) = ?
	0xAD ^ 0xC7 = ?

How would you clear the 5th and 6th bits in a register while leaving the other's alone?

What is the maximum speed the STM32F072R8 GPIO pins can handle in the lowest speed setting?

What RCC register would you manipulate to enable the following peripherals:
	TIM1(TIMER1)
	DMA1
	I2C1were a
